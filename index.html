<center> <div class='border3'> <p>Thankyou so much for joining in. Here lets talk about your finances and how you can make the best out of it.
          Personal finance is not taught in most schools and unfortunatly we have to learn through trial and error. It is not ok to feel 
        out of control with your personal finances. Try to keep 20% of your income set on your future goal, 30% towards your life style,
        50% set on your essentials.</p></div></center>

     <center> <div class='border3'>  <p>Personal credit! This Article is going to be about personal credit! Please don't believe everything you hear on the internet or what people tell you. Only go off of 
      personal experience or someone you know personally has went through it. Personally I have went to dealerships and helped people get more information about making smart decisions
      with their money.I personally desire to be super wealthy but I am building my credit off the instruments I post in these articles. I just got tired of the mistakes I have made so that has led me do tons 
      of research giving me an array of knowledge . For instance, going to the dealership and getting a brand knew car, my first time ever going and getting a new car made me one proud American. If I would have known anything about credit maybe 
      I would have went ahead and bought a 370Z or an even better car, but I was young I did not know the impact of good credit. First time credit car buyers and first time home owners can get better interest
      rates than previous home and car buyers especially if you have good credit. Investors, banks,and even jobs would love to give you offers and deals based on your credibility.
      So paying attention to your credit card balances and staying a student to your spending is always a huge important lesson people need to learn. Car sales men have to get their 
      quota every month they have to reach their sales goal that's just facts. Us as the buyers must be knowledgeable enough to know how to strike good deals and when the sales are at an all time low.
      You see; buying your friends house or car might be pretty cool but knowing how to leverage credit lead to much better deals down the road, and knowing how to make your money work for you can be
      even more rewarding. Business is all fair when it comes to getting ahead in life and there are open source documents there are on the computer. Make sure you stay a student, read or atleast skim over the important
      paper work and not give it to a lawyer and or banker if you're so inclined. I would recommend going to your bank institution and ask for paper work on credit and home buying or even loans just to see where you stand
       so you can get an easy head start.</p></div></center>

<center> <div class='border3'> <p> I would not recommend getting a credit with an interest rate higher than 5% unless you plan on paying the money back fast. There are alot of accentric aspects about personal finance
      that should be in everybodies memories. Keep a check of the transactions you make, all the transactions you make. No matter how many millions you
      make you will make an ample more when you put your money in the right place. Making the proper investments by buying things that 
      appreciate over time is just smart investing,"If you're into that sort of stuff". Making a business does not sound bad either
      but that is a story for another day. You want your money to do more than you need it to not just do the medium but to do the most! Remember your
      finances do alot for the poised suiter.</p></div></center>
