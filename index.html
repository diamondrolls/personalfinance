     <h1>Understanding Your Savings Goals</h1>
<center>  <ul>
	<li> <b>Thankyou so much for joining in. Here lets talk about your finances and how you can make the best out of it.
          Personal finance has alot to do with your taxes and how you prepare your savings. It is not ok to feel 
        out of control with your personal finances. Try to keep 20% of your income set on your future goal, 30% towards your life style,
        50% set on your essentials. If you have a very low income have more than two kids you may be entitled to the Earned Income Credit Program. 
		Recipients of this program could get up to $10,000 in refunded taxes. </b></li></ul></center>

     <br>
   
    <h1>Personal Credit</h1>
     <center>  <ul>
	<li> <b>Personal credit! This Article is going to be about personal credit! Please don't believe everything you hear on the internet or what people tell you. Only go off of 
      personal experience or someone you know personally has went through it. Personally I have went to dealerships and helped people get more information about making smart decisions
      with their money.I personally desire to be super wealthy but I am building my credit off the instruments I post in these articles. I just got tired of the mistakes I have made so that has led me do tons 
      of research giving me an array of knowledge . For instance, going to the dealership and getting a brand knew car, my first time ever going and getting a new car made me one proud American. If I would have known anything about credit maybe 
      I would have went ahead and bought a 370Z or an even better car, but I was young I did not know the impact of good credit. First time credit car buyers and first time home owners can get better interest
      rates than previous home and car buyers especially if you have good credit. Investors, banks,and even jobs would love to give you offers and deals based on your credibility.
      So paying attention to your credit card balances and staying a student to your spending is always a huge important lesson people need to learn. Car sales men have to get their 
      quota every month they have to reach their sales goal that's just facts. Us as the buyers must be knowledgeable enough to know how to strike good deals and when the sales are at an all time low.
      You see; buying your friends house or car might be pretty cool but knowing how to leverage credit lead to much better deals down the road, and knowing how to make your money work for you can be
      even more rewarding. Business is all fair when it comes to getting ahead in life and there are open source documents there are on the computer. Make sure you stay a student, read or atleast skim over the important
      paper work and not give it to a lawyer and or banker if you're so inclined. I would recommend going to your bank institution and ask for paper work on credit and home buying or even loans just to see where you stand
       so you can get an easy head start.</b></li></ul></center>

   <h1>Which Type Of Credit Cards Are The Best</h1>
<center>   <ul>
	<li> <b> I would not recommend getting a credit with an interest rate higher than 5% unless you plan on paying the money back fast. There are alot of accentric aspects about personal finance
      that should be in everybodies memories. Keep a check of the transactions you make, all the transactions you make. No matter how many millions you
      make you will make an ample more when you put your money in the right place. Making the proper investments by buying things that 
      appreciate over time is just smart investing,"If you're into that sort of stuff". Making a business does not sound bad either
      but that is a story for another day. You want your money to do more than you need it to not just do the medium but to do the most! Remember your
      finances do alot for the poised suiter.</b></li></ul></center>

	  <h1>Capitalism</h1>
    <center>   <ul>
	<li> <b> There are good aspects about credit and there are bad aspects about credit. Paying off a car loan you defaulted on or had gotten repoed is one
  example of a bad credit. You can make the money you want through credit but you have to look into your skills and make decisive decisions on the best options you have around you.
  . You have realestate, money, wifi, people, bills and merchandise, etc.However, if you want more bang for your buck credit might provide you with the answers you need. Start off with a secured
  credit card and basically compound interest based on a point system. The more credit you have the more you can buy the things you really want to get approved for. Save more for the bigger purchases
  and be sure to build a history of all the payments you are making or have already made. Also having a diversified portfolio is a better way of making the lenders throw money at you.
  You want to build up your proftfolio like its an instagram page, or stock portfolio, diversified and interesting, but never in the negative. There are multiple ways of doing this and
  one of the more simple ways is to apply for many credit cards but spend only the money you would normally spend on groceries or food or a date and make sure you pay it off in full at the
  the end of the month. This will most definately increase your credit score and once you have done this with a few credit cards you should look into having a charge card or a rewards card.
  These cards can pay for free air fair much more. Having diversity in your credit history is good and having a long credit history is also very well. You can find great places like credit karma
  to check your credit and you should always monitor your credit and history. Never close your your credit card because you want to keep your credit history intact and flowing.
  Remember you should alway keep credit in its place and use it responsibly. There are penalties to not paying loans off on time and your credit might go down which in terms would 
  hinder you from getting lower interest rates or making and some business would think you're more of a risk factor. We Are going to assume you are trust worthy. Even if you get 10,000,000 dollars 
  in credit try to utilize only 5 percent of that which would be 500,000 dollars, this makes you look more responsible and it shows poise in your spending cognizence.</b></li></ul></center>
